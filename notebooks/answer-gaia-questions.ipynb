    "## README\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to interact with a **Question Answering Multi-Agent System (QAMAS)** built using the **Reflex framework**. Reflex provides an event-driven environment that supports the orchestration of modular, reactive agents to collaboratively answer complex user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is specifically tailored for completing the **GAIA Hands-on Challenge** from the [Hugging Face Agents Course – Unit 4](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit4/hands-on). It automates the process of retrieving evaluation questions, generating answers using a Reflex-powered multi-agent architecture, and submitting the responses back to Hugging Face for scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is organized into three key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract Phase**  \n",
    "   Retrieves a set of GAIA questions using the Hugging Face API. These questions are part of the official evaluation and require high-quality, reliable responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GAIA Question Answering**  \n",
    "   Uses the Reflex multi-agent system to answer each question by dynamically routing it through the appropriate agent pipeline. This phase showcases the collaborative and reactive capabilities of the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Load Phase**  \n",
    "   Submits the generated answers to the Hugging Face evaluation endpoint and retrieves scores that reflect the system's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The QAMAS follows a modular, pipeline-based architecture where each agent has a specialized role and communicates asynchronously via the Reflex environment. The interaction is initiated by the **Router Agent**, which delegates the query to a suitable path based on the nature of the question. Each path ends with a **Verifier Agent** ensuring the accuracy and quality of the response before the final answer is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agent Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Router Agent**  \n",
    "  The Router analyzes each GAIA question and dynamically routes it to the correct downstream agent(s):\n",
    "  - **Factual or up-to-date queries** → Researcher\n",
    "  - **Logical/mathematical reasoning** → Reasoner\n",
    "  - **Structured/tabular data** → Data Analyst\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analysis Agent**  \n",
    "  Specializes in interpreting structured data (e.g., CSVs, tables) and performing:\n",
    "  - Aggregations\n",
    "  - Pattern recognition\n",
    "  - Calculations and filtering\n",
    "  - Format-compliant reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Researcher Agent**  \n",
    "  Gathers external or current information from reliable sources using:\n",
    "  - Search queries\n",
    "  - Clarifying sub-questions\n",
    "  - Web tools or APIs (if available)\n",
    "  - Source evaluation and synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reasoner Agent**  \n",
    "  Handles logical and mathematical queries by:\n",
    "  - Applying formal reasoning techniques\n",
    "  - Executing step-by-step deduction or computation\n",
    "  - Validating solutions with alternative approaches when necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generator Agent (Initial & Final)**  \n",
    "  Responsible for transforming intermediate outputs into concise final answers. Ensures:\n",
    "  - Clean formatting\n",
    "  - Adherence to expected answer type (e.g., string, list, number)\n",
    "  - Incorporation of verification feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verifier Agent**  \n",
    "  Evaluates the quality of the generated answer:\n",
    "  - Confirms factual and logical accuracy\n",
    "  - Ensures strict format compliance\n",
    "  - Highlights inconsistencies or omissions\n",
    "\n",
    "  If issues are found, it routes feedback to the Generator for answer refinement. This feedback loop improves both precision and robustness, especially important for evaluation benchmarks like GAIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Pipeline Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the nature of each GAIA question, the system dynamically selects one of the following processing routes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured Data Questions**  \n",
    "  `Router → Data Analyst → Generator → Verifier → Generator`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factual + Reasoning Questions (Multi-hop)**  \n",
    "  `Router → Researcher → Reasoner → Generator → Verifier → Generator`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logical/Mathematical Questions**  \n",
    "  `Router → Reasoner → Generator → Verifier → Generator`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pipeline concludes with a **Verifier-Generator** cycle that improves answer fidelity and ensures conformity to GAIA’s evaluation format and quality expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves both as a demonstration of Reflex-based agent collaboration and as a working solution for the Hugging Face GAIA evaluation challenge.\n"
